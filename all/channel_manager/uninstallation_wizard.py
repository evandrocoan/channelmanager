        process for all the %s packages.

        not be downgraded to the version you used before installing this package. After running this
        wizard, you need to reinstall the packages you want to be restored to their original
        versions.

        packages, or some cases when the installer is not complete, the PackagesManager could not be
        installed (as it is installed by last). Then the Uninstaller cannot run as it requires
        PackagesManager instead of Package Control. Therefore on these cases the user is required to
        install manually PackagesManager, before running the %s uninstaller.
