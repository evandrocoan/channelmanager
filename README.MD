# Channel Manager

The plugin `channel_manager.py` creates the files `channel.json` and `repository.json` based on the
`.gitmodules` file on the Sublime Text Data folder (the folder at `Packages/../`). To call it, you
can open the command palette and type `YourChannelName: Generate Channel File`. See the following

## Introduction <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

channelmanager is dependency which manages the packages installed by git as submodules. It allows to
create the channel files required by Package Control to list and install packages. It is Currently
implemented two different bundle of package bounded by `.gitmodules` files. The
[StudioChannel](https://github.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel) and the
[AmxxChannel](https://github.com/evandrocoan/AmxxChannel).

1. **StudioChannel** This is one of the first channels implemented using the `channelmanager`. It
   contains about 100 packages for the stable version and 150 for the development version. It has a
   custom installation wizard to guide you through the installation steps and therefore call the
   `channelmanager`'s installer passing the required configurations for the
   [SublimeStudio](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeStudio).

1. **AmxxChannel** This is a smaller channel of packages with about 20 packages focused on just for
   programming for AMX Mod X Pawn language at
   [AmxxSimpleIDE](https://github.com/evandrocoan/AmxxSimpleIDE)

The channel creation is based on the existence of a
[.gitmodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmodules) file on the root of your Sublime Text Data
folder. For example, at the portable version of Sublime Text the folder structure would look like
this:
```java
$ tree
.
├── .git
│   ├── COMMIT_EDITMSG
|   ...
├── .gitmodules
├── Cache
│   ├── ActionScript
│   │   └── ActionScript.sublime-syntax.cache
|   ...
├── Installed Packages
│   ├── 0_package_control_loader.sublime-package
│   ├── Amxx Pawn.sublime-package
│   ...
├── KEEPME
|   ...
└── Packages
    ├── amxmodx
    │   ├── amxx.sublime-settings
    ...
```

The contents of the file `.gitmodules` follow the requirements by
[.gitmodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmodules), but also including new keys used to generate the
channel files. Currently there are implemented the following keys:
```java
[submodule "Packages/Notepad++ Color Scheme"]
    path = Packages/Notepad++ Color Scheme
    url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeNotepadPlusPlusTheme
    upstream =
    branches = master->master
```

The `upstream` can be empty or not present if you would like to. It is used to set your repository
`upstream` when the project is a fork of some another project. For example, let us suppose you liked
the project `https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeNotepadPlusPlusTheme` and created a fork of it on
Github. Now, instead of installing the original package from `evandrocoan`, you installed your fork,
from your address `https://github.com/your_user_name/SublimeNotepadPlusPlusTheme`, then you would
set the `upstream` key pointing to the original repository and the `url` key for your fork of it.

The keys `upstream` and `branches` are used to create create pull-requests from the upstream remotes
with the Python Module [githubpullrequests](https://github.com/evandrocoan/githubpullrequests), 
and by commands like `Pull & Rebase all Upstreams` (see section [#commands-go-to-top](#commands-go-to-top)).


### Tags Management <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

You can create specific settings for each repository on the file `settings.json`,
which should be put on the aimed repository root directory of repository.
See this `settings.json` file example, on the root of `Notepad++ Color Scheme` package:
```json
{
    "tags":
    [
        "3144"
    ]
}
```

The `tags` is a list of remote tags and the version of Sublime they are aimed to be
used. For example, `tags = 3143, 3147` indicates the repository `Notepad++ Color Scheme` has the
following git tags called `3143` and `3147`.

Note, if some value of the `tag` option is not an integer, the download/url link will point to that
name. For example, if you set `tag = master`, the download link will always point the master branch.
This is useful when you are want a package to always be downloaded from the latest version on the
master branch.

Settings tags like `3143` is useful when a package has ceased working for old build of Sublime Text.
For example, on Sublime Text development build `3147`, the package `Notepad++ Color Scheme` stopped
working completely ([CoreIssue$1983](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1983)) however
the fix for build `3147` also broke completely the package for Sublime Text stable build `3143`.
Hence, we must to create a tag which targets the last commit which is working for build `3143`.
Moreover, when some user using the stable build `3143` installs the `Notepad++ Color Scheme`, they
must install the one from the tag `3143`, and not the one from the master branch, which has the
latest fixes for build development build `3144` or newer. Stills also to do automatic tagging of the
latest release package is working for Sublime Text as the tag `3143` just mentioned, however this
seems not much required to be done as should there be only a few exceptions for when a packages
stops working for some build of Sublime Text.

Currently the channel generation is limited to setting the download link to a tag pointing to the
the repository master branch. For now, it is disabled all tag prefixes, i.e., tags which are not
strictly "0.0.0", because we cannot handle repositories which have a tag prefix for each platforms
as Linux and Windows. Then we create a unified tag which is based on the current master branch.
Despite it was implemented the checking for each submodule for the latest tag available, then
properly setting the download URL pointing to the last tag, based on the latest commit date.
Currently it is only partially implemented the tag management. It is required to also implement on
the `.gitmodules` file, the `tag_prefix` field to select which is the tag prefix, and for which
platform.

It would be useful for tagging a large set of packages which can be considered stable. This approach
should be much batter than the current one where the user always download the current version
available at the master branch when the user installed the package. Such approach is not very
welcomed because would allow several clients to be using different versions of the package while all
of them think they are using the latest version available at the moment, however just the most
recent installations would be using the lasted version, whereas the other installations would be
using some older version.


### Submodules Manager <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

The plugin `submodules_manager.py` run several operations based on the `.gitmodules` file on the
Sublime Text Data folder (the folder at `Packages/../`) and `Backstroke.gitmodules` file on the
Sublime Text Data folder (the folder at `Packages/../Local`). However, still to do a implementation
of a configuration which will allow you to change the locations of these files by settings files. So
you can put them where you please most. Here is a sample of the structure of both files:

**.gitmodules**
```shell
[submodule "Packages/Better CoffeeScript"]
    path = Packages/Better CoffeeScript
    url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/sublime-better-coffeescript
    upstream = https://github.com/aponxi/sublime-better-coffeescript
    branches = master->master
[submodule "Packages/BufferScroll"]
    path = Packages/BufferScroll
    url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/BufferScroll
    upstream = https://github.com/titoBouzout/BufferScroll
    branches = master->master
```

**Backstroke.gitmodules**
```shell
[submodule "Packages"]
    url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/Packages
    upstream = https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages
    branches = master_upstream_branch->master_fork_branch

[submodule "Packages/ANSIescape"]
    url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeANSI
    upstream = https://github.com/aziz/SublimeANSI
    branches = master_upstream_branch->master_fork_branch
```

Hence, if you would like to receive updates from the
`https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeNotepadPlusPlusTheme` upstream, you can set the key `upstream`
pointing to the upstream of the original package at
`https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeNotepadPlusPlusTheme`. Therefore, your settings file would
look like:
```java
[submodule "Packages/Notepad++ Color Scheme"]
    path = Packages/Notepad++ Color Scheme
    url = https://github.com/your_user_name/SublimeNotepadPlusPlusTheme
    upstream = https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeNotepadPlusPlusTheme
    branches = master->master
```

Sadly, this feature is not implemented yet. However, the `upstream` key is used by the plugin
`submodules_manager.py`, with the command line argument `-f`. The `submodules_manager.py` provides
some commands which are not available from Sublime Text due they being too long to run. Moreover,
it is proper to use a dedicated shell for them. You can see the available options for the
`submodules_manager.py` by running it:
```java
$ python3 submodules_manager.py
[submodules_manager.py] 14:44:07  454080    2707 Entering on main(0) None
[submodules_manager.py] 14:44:07  454322     242 ( print_command_line_arguments ) len(sys.argv): 1
[submodules_manager.py] 14:44:07  454403      81 ( print_command_line_arguments ) arg: submodules_manager.py
usage: submodules_manager.py [-h] [-a] [-b] [-f] [-p] [-t]

Update Sublime Text Channel

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -a, --all         Generate all assets
  -b, --backstroke  Check all backstroke registered repositories updates with
                    their upstream. The backstroke URLs are now in a separate
                    file on: Local/Backstroke.gitmodules
  -f, --find-forks  Find all repositories forks, fetch their branches and
                    clean the duplicated branches. The upstream data in on the
                    `.gitmodules` file on: Sublime Text `Data` folder
  -p, --pull        Perform a git pull from the remote repositories
  -t, --push-tags   Perform a git push for all submodules tags to their
                    respective remote repository
```

By just calling the `submodules_manager.py` with the `--find-forks` argument, it will run
automatically through all your git submodules listed on the file `.gitmodules`. But still to do a
argument to be passed to the command to allow select one specific repository to run the command,
instead of running it right away through all your installed repositories, thing which can take
several hours.

The `find_forks` command call the python package
[find_forks](https://github.com/frost-nzcr4/find_forks) which finds all forks of user/repository on
github and add it as git remote to your local cloned repository. It is useful to find interesting
commits of old repository with many updated forks, fresh repository with many forks that original
author doesn't want or doesn't have time to merge.


### Channel Installer/uninstaller <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

The plugins `channel_installer.py`/`channel_uninstaller.py` performs the installation and
uninstallation of the of all the channel packages by the `Package Control` when installing the
Stable Version, or by `git` when installing the Development Version of the channel.

Currently the installer has some hard coded configurations which are implemented directly on the
code. But futurely they should be moved on from the dependency `channelmanager` to the package which
actually is using the dependency `channelmanager` to do the channel administration.

## How to Build a Channel <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

The original purpose of the channel is to be small, something like just a few hundred of packages.
However, you can scale up, if you do not actually install everything as a git submodule. The channel
can in also be installed at once, including all its packages. That means, if you have big channel
like with 1000 packages, you can call the channel installer, and those 1000 packages are going to be
installed in your Sublime Text.

The installer provides two installation alternatives,
the Development Version and the Stable Version.
By installing the Stable Version,
all the packages in your channel are going to be installed,
except the one listed in the `PACKAGES_TO_IGNORE_ON_DEVELOPMENT` setting.
Then, for example,
you can have as much as 1000 packages in your channel,
but list 960 of them by their names at the `PACKAGES_TO_IGNORE_ON_DEVELOPMENT` setting.
Hence only 40 packages are going to be installed when the channel installer run.

However,
this is only true if the user is installing the Stable Version of the channel.
The Development Version will clone by `git` all the 1000 packages and then add the 960 packages
listed on the `PACKAGES_TO_IGNORE_ON_DEVELOPMENT` file to the user `ignored_packages` settings.

This was designed like that because the original goal of this is to be just a small channel for a
few packages you always install,
or are developing.
However,
if you wish to scale up building very large channels,
you can just decide not to use the channel installer to install the channel packages and just pick
they one by one,
as you usually do with the default `Package Control` channel.

1. Install Sublime Text portable version, you can download it at:
   [https://www.sublimetext.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

1. Open your Sublime Text loose `Packages` folder by going the menu `Preferences -> Browse
   Packages...` Now open a command line you the folder which just opened:

   <details>
   <p>

   **Linux**
   ![Opening Linux Command Line](http://i.imgur.com/VA4zC7F.gif)
   </p>
   </details><br>

   <details>
   <p>

   **Windows**
   ![Opening Windows Command Line](http://i.imgur.com/iYwE4IO.gif)
   </p>
   </details><br>

1. Use your command line and go to the parent folder of your `Packages` folder, and create a git
   repository, which will hold/tie together all the packages available in you channel. For example:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   git init
   printf "# Main Repository\n\nFor my packages' channel." > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Added README.md"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your_user_name/main_repository
   ```

1. Now your `Main Repository` is set up, use the same command line to install the Packages you want
   to add to your channel and adding them as git submodules to the main repository. For example:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter "Packages/GitGutter"
   git submodule add -- https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter "Packages/GitGutter"
   git commit -m "Added the first package to my channel."
   ```

1. Now your `.gitmodules` file was created by git. It should look like this:
   ```java
   [submodule "Packages/GitGutter"]
       path = Packages/GitGutter
       url = https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter
   ```

   With this setup, you can customize your file adding the required information to build up the channel.
   Let us start by adding the keys for the `channelmanager` installer & uninstaller:
   ```java
   [submodule "Packages/GitGutter"]
       path = Packages/GitGutter
       url = https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter

   [submodule "Packages/channelmanager"]
       path = Packages/channelmanager
       url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeChannelManager
       upstream =
   ```

   The packages `channelmanager` is responsible for generating the channel files,
   installing and uninstalling them.
   As it is set on the `.gitmodules` file,
   You can read more about the dependency load order on [Package Control, Docs: Dependencies](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/dependencies)

   As it is a dependency,
   if you just skip it, i.e.,
   not add this entry to your `.gitmodules` file as `Package Control` will fail to install
   it when you requires it on the actual package which provides the commands,
   because:

      1. The installation could just not work, if the dependency `channelmanager` and
         `debugtools` are not available on the `Package Control` default channel.
      1. You cannot use all the features available because currently it is dependent on git
         submodules and Package Control cannot clone the submodules together yet. Therefore, cannot
         use the features dependent on the submodules as the `find_forks` command.

   But also, you can add `channelmanager` to enforce the policy of development, adding
   `channelmanager` here allow you to easily edit its code, fix bugs or improve whatever it is doing
   as you already have a full git repository at hand, you just need to change the remote to a new
   repository or for a fork of yours at GitHub.

   Therefore as you may notice,
   was skipped the addition of the dependency `debugtools`,
   as it is not dependent on git submodules and there is not much room for improvement or changes on it.
   However,
   if you like you can also add it as a package.
   You just need to add the following entry to your `.gitmodules`:
   ```java
   [submodule "Packages/GitGutter"]
       path = Packages/GitGutter
       url = https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter

   [submodule "Packages/channelmanager"]
       path = Packages/channelmanager
       url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeChannelManager
       upstream =

   [submodule "Packages/debugtools"]
       path = Packages/debugtools
       url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/debugtools
       upstream =
   ```

1. Now you added the basics, you may notice they were not added as `git submodules` by the commands
   `git clone --recursive repo_url` and `git submodule add -- repo_url "Packages/package_name"`.
   Moreover you can or cannot do so if you like. The `channelmanager` only requires to the file
   `.gitmodules` to exists in the pre-configured location, which we are about do to. Other than
   that, you do not need to have a parent repository which holds a valid `.gitmodules` file by your
   `git` client.

   However, it is required for some commands available to work properly as the command `Pull &
   Rebase all Packages`. Beyond that advised and nice to have a parent repository which validly by
   `git` ties together all the packages, because you can in only open place manage all your packages
   and easily create commits, pulls, pushes, etc. On this picture we can see some of this
   integration by a `git client Graphic Interface`:

   ![git client Graphic Interface](https://i.imgur.com/Q3DngpF.png)

   To create the channel you need the configuration loader for the dependency `channelmanager`. This
   configuration loader would be a Sublime Text Package which requires the `channelmanager` as a
   dependency and call its installer, uninstaller and commands available passing the configuration
   required by the `channelmanager` dependency to run its operations.

   First of all let us create the folder for our new channel, you can name it as you like as long as
   there is no other package installed with the same. Assuming you still have the command line
   opened on the folder we were before, you can create the folder for the your channel:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "Packages/MyBrandNewChannel"
   cd "Packages/MyBrandNewChannel"
   git init
   ```

   But without forgetting, we need to create an entry for the channel on our `.gitmodules` file. At
   the end of it all, the `.gitmodules` would look like this for the channel named
   `MyBrandNewChannel`:
   ```java
   [submodule "Packages/GitGutter"]
       path = Packages/GitGutter
       url = https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter

   [submodule "Packages/channelmanager"]
       path = Packages/channelmanager
       url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeChannelManager
       upstream =

   [submodule "Packages/debugtools"]
       path = Packages/debugtools
       url = https://github.com/evandrocoan/debugtools
       upstream =

   [submodule "Packages/MyBrandNewChannel"]
       path = Packages/MyBrandNewChannel
       url = https://github.com/your_user_name/MyBrandNewChannel
       upstream =
   ```

   * Note: Due Package Control currently not accept dependencies requiring dependencies, we also
     need to add the `channelmanager` dependencies to the `MyBrandNewChannel` dependencies list:

   **dependencies.json**
   ```javascript
   {
       "windows": {
           ">3000": [
               "python-pywin32",
               "portalockerfile",
               "concurrentloghandler",
               "debugtools"
           ]
       },
       "*": {
           "*": [
               "portalockerfile",
               "concurrentloghandler",
               "debugtools"
           ]
       }
   }
   ```

     On this case,
     we added the dependency `debugtools` to the `MyBrandNewChannel` dependencies list,
     as `channelmanager` requires the `debugtools` as dependency.
     See the following issue for details about when this should be correctly supported by `Package Control`:

     1. [package_control#1300](https://github.com/wbond/package_control/issues/1300) If a dependency has a dependency, its dependencies are not installed

   * Note: We need to add the entry `tag = master` on the `MyBrandNewChannel` repository entry due
     the `channelmanager` installer get the packages names list to install from the current
     installed version of `MyBrandNewChannel` repository. Then if we only download the latest tag
     for `MyBrandNewChannel`, we will miss installing the latest added packages, unless the
     `MyBrandNewChannel` is re-tagged right after the creation of the `channel.json` and
     `repository.json` files.

1. Now on this new package called `Packages/MyBrandNewChannel`,
   you need to create the plugin to call the `channelmanager` passing the required configurations.
   In the following we may see a full example configuration file,
   you can save it inside the folder `Packages/MyBrandNewChannel` with the name you like most as `settings.py`:
   ```python
   import os

   # from debug_tools.third_part import print_all_variables_for_debugging
   # if 'g_channelSettings' in globals(): print_all_variables_for_debugging( g_channelSettings )
   # import sublime_plugin; sublime_plugin.reload_plugin( "channel_manager.channel_utilities" )

   from debug_tools.third_part import clean_urljoin
   from channel_manager.channel_utilities import run_channel_setup

   CURRENT_PACKAGE_FILE   = os.path.dirname( os.path.realpath( __file__ ) )
   PACKAGE_ROOT_DIRECTORY = CURRENT_PACKAGE_FILE.replace( ".sublime-package", "" )
   CURRENT_PACKAGE_NAME   = os.path.basename( PACKAGE_ROOT_DIRECTORY )

   def plugin_loaded():
       global g_channelSettings
       CHANNEL_RAW_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your_user_name/MyBrandNewChannel/master/"

       g_channelSettings = {}
       g_channelSettings['CHANNEL_ROOT_URL']    = "https://github.com/your_user_name/MyParentRepository"
       g_channelSettings['DEFAULT_CHANNEL_URL'] = "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json"

       g_channelSettings['CHANNEL_FILE_URL']  = clean_urljoin( CHANNEL_RAW_URL, "channel.json" )
       g_channelSettings['CHANNEL_FILE_PATH'] = os.path.join( PACKAGE_ROOT_DIRECTORY, "channel.json" )

       g_channelSettings['CHANNEL_REPOSITORY_URL']  = clean_urljoin( CHANNEL_RAW_URL, "repository.json" )
       g_channelSettings['CHANNEL_REPOSITORY_FILE'] = os.path.join( PACKAGE_ROOT_DIRECTORY, "repository.json" )

       g_channelSettings['PACKAGES_TO_INSTALL_FIRST'] = \
       [
           "My First Package",
           "My Second Package",
           "My Third Package",
       ]

           There are two versions of the channel. Each one of them has its proper usage depending on
           your plans. The Stable Version is the most tested and trusted set of packages to be
           installed. It contains all the packages which can be actively enabled and used on daily
           basis usage and it requires the latest Stable Build of Sublime Text available, as builds
           3126 and 3143.

           The Development Version has the same packages as the Stable Version, however it also
           installs candidate packages to the Stable Version, i.e., packages which are not thoroughly
           tested. Some of them are expected to have serious bugs as crash your Sublime Text,
           significantly slow down the Sublime Text performance, i.e., create great problems. Due this,
           these extra packages are by default added to your `ignored_packages` settings. You should
           only enable them when you are attempting to fix their problems or test them.

           For both Stable and Development versions, your Sublime Text's Package Control will be
           uninstalled and replaced by the its forked version called `PackagesManager`. Now on, you
           should look for the package `PackagesManager` to install and uninstalling packages. The
           Stable Version installs all packages by PackagesManager as they normally are installed by
           the Sublime Text's Package Control. Therefore they require smaller amount of space in your
           file system. It should be about 60MB of data, on the last time checked.

           Now the Development Version installs all your packages by `git`, therefore you need to have
           git installed in your system in order to install the development Version. Also due this, the
           Development Version requires much more file system space. The last time checked it required
           about 600MB of free space. Notice also, the Development Version requires the latest
           Development Build of Sublime Text available, as builds 3141 and 3147.

implementation is similar to the one presented just above. However, the `StudioChannel` is pretty
much different. It employs use concept of Installation Wizard, presenting a survey of the contents

## How to Use a Channel <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

The Channel is usable by two ways, the first is to create a big channel as Package Control with like
2000 packages or much more, listed by the `.gitmodules` file. The second is by creating a small
channel of packages with with just a few packages as about 10 or 100 packages.

The first usage is when you intend just create big list of packages for sharing like Package Control
does. This would not allow anyone to attempt to use the channel installer, as it would install all
the packages, which is a lot of them. However this has the downside of requiring all the packages to
be cloned on your computer for generating the `channel.json` and `repository.json` file.

It is made like to so it is not required to have an GitHub API token access, as you can only perform
60 access per hour without one. Now instead of pulling GitHub server with requests for the packages
data, we just access it by the command line interface as the package is cloned locally in your
computer.

The second usage is when you intend to share with our work colleagues or friends, a bundled set of
packages for Sublime Text. You can just pass the channel URL for them to add it to the Package
Control channel's list, then they can install your channel and run its installer.

When the user finish the installation of the channel, the `channelmanager` dependency will show up a
message dialog informing whether the installation was successful or not:

![Successful Installation Message Dialog](https://i.imgur.com/GcGa2MY.png)


### Multiple Channels Installation <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

You can install as many Stable Versions of the channels as you want to. However, the Development
Version due its nature can only have one installed. If you attempt to install a second Development
Version, the `channelmanager` will not let you. But it stills installing the packages which are not
present on the current installed channel.

Despite you cannot install multiple Development Versions, you can still install one Development
Version and as much Stable Versions you would like to. Nevertheless, the packages which each channel
have in common, are going to overridden accordingly to the channels installation order. For example,
if you installed a Channel A, then another Channel B, and both channels have in common the same
Package C, the implementation of the Package C, by the Channel A, will be overridden by the
implementation of the Channel B, i.e., they are overridden accordingly to the order of the most
recent channel installation.

It is also implemented on the `channelmanager` dependency, an short installation wizard which should
allow you to choose which packages of Channel you do not want to install. Therefore you could select
which of these packages you would like to install over the packages you already has installed.
However, this list limited by the setting `FORBIDDEN_PACKAGES` which specify packages which must be
installed. If the user do not agree with installing these packages, then he cannot install the
channel.



___
## Commands <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

It provides the following commands on command palette. Note these commands only works if you
installed the Development Version of the channel:

1. **YourChannelName: Generate Channel File** Creates the files `channel.json`, `repositories.json`.
   The file `channel.json` and `repositories.json` are the same file as the Package Control's
   [channel_v3.json](https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json) file. You can read more about them
   at [Package Control, Docs: Channels and
   Repositories](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/channels_and_repositories)

1. **YourChannelName: Select Packages to Update Git Tag** Before running this command, you must have
   already called `Generate Channel File` to create the channel files, as this commands just load
   those files and create a git tag as performed on the command `Generate Channel File`,
   however the tag is only created if it does not already exists a tag for the current/latest
   commit. Also, the tag is immediately pushed to origin.

1. **YourChannelName: Update All Packages Git Tag** Similar to the last command `Select Package
   to Update Git Tag`, but it create git tags for each repository on based on the date of the last
   commit. If there is no git tags, a first tag is created as `1.0.0`. If already there are git tags, its
   patch component (or major.minor.patch) is incremented in one.

1. **YourChannelName: Cancel Current Operation** If there is some operation currently running, it
   will be cancelled some time after this command is called. Please, do not call cancel and immediately
   call some other operation. Wait a a few seconds until the operation stops.

1. **YourChannelName: Run Backstroke Requests** Backstroke is a Github bot to keep repository forks up
   to date with their upstream. Therefore, if you setup your own list of Backstroke URLs, you can
   run this command to ping all your URLs, so their upstreams are checked whether there are some
   missing updates.

1. **YourChannelName: Push Local Git Tags** Walk through all git repositories and perform the `git
   push --tags` command, i.e., perform a git push for all submodules tags to their respective remote
   repository.

1. **YourChannelName: Fetch All Submodules remote origin** Walk through all git repositories and
   perform the `git fetch origin` command, i.e., fetch the updates from the origin, using python
   script which walk recursively into submodules of submodules. This command also which display the
   remaining time.

1. **YourChannelName: Pull & Rebase all Submodules (git)** Walk through all git repositories and
   perform the `git pull --rebase` command, i.e., fetch the updates from the origin and merge the
   changes by rebase, using git submodules which walk recursively into submodules of submodules and
   performing checkout on their master branch.

1. **YourChannelName: Pull & Rebase all Submodules (python)** Walk through all git repositories and
   perform the `git pull --rebase` command, i.e., fetch the updates from the origin and merge the
   changes by rebase, using python script which walk recursively into submodules of submodules but
   does not checkout on their master branch.

   Notice it is required to they to be checkout on some branch before doing git pull. Then it is
   useful to run first the command `Pull & Rebase all Packages (git)` when you first install the git
   submodules and on the remaining times, call this command which display the remaining time.

1. **YourChannelName: Pull & Rebase all Upstreams** (Not Yet Implemented) Walk through all git
   repositories and perform `git remote add upstream_url`, checkout on the specified remote branch,
   and do a git merge with the upstream contents.

1. **YourChannelName: Add All Upstreams Remotes** Walk through all git repositories and add as
   remote their upstream set on the file `.gitmodules`, if it exists. The upstream will have the
   username of the upstream user.

1. **YourChannelName: Delete All remote Except origin** Walk through all git repositories and delete
   all remotes which are not `origin` and the `upstream username`. This is useful to clean all the
   remotes repositories after running the `find_forks` command.

1. **YourChannelName: Extract Default Package** Run the script `copy_default_package.py` which
   unpack_settings the `Default.sublime-package` at the on the `Packages/../` folder, i.e., on the
   folder which the Sublime Text loose packages are, not inside it. This command automatically runs
   when you install a new version of Sublime Text, therefore the command is only here when you want
   to force it to override the current files.

1. **YourChannelName: Run Stable Installation** Run the script `channel_installer.py` which install
   all the channel Stable Version packages which are configured to be installed accordingly to the
   file `settings.py` at `YourChannelName` channel repository.

   The installer can only be run once. If the installation was interrupted by closing Sublime Text,
   you first need to call the command `Run Uninstallation` to uninstall all the installed packages
   and only then to call this installer the `Run Stable Installation` command again.

1. **YourChannelName: Run Development Installation** Run the script `channel_installer.py` which
   install all the channel Development Version packages which are configured to be installed
   accordingly to the file `settings.py` at `YourChannelName` channel repository.

   The installer can only be run once. If the installation was interrupted by closing Sublime Text,
   you first need to call the command `Run Uninstallation` to uninstall all the installed packages
   and only then to call this installer the `Run Stable Installation` command again.

1. **YourChannelName: Run Uninstallation** Run the script `channel_uninstaller.py` which uninstall
   all the channel Stable or Development Version packages which were installed accordingly to the
   file `settings.py` at `YourChannelName` channel repository.

   The uninstaller run multiple, if the uninstallation was interrupted by closing Sublime Text, you
   can call the command `Run Uninstallation` continue to uninstall all the installed packages once
   you start Sublime Text again.

## Installation Notes <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#channel-manager)</sub></sub>

1. This may show up close to the installation end:

   ![error: PackagesManager](https://i.imgur.com/bmZ5Jso.png)
   ```
   error: PackagesManager

   The package specified, Package Control, is not installed

                   If there will be new messages on the next seconds,
                   they will be show on the Sublime Text console
   ```

   You can just ignore this. It happens because both PackagesManager and the installer try to
   uninstall `Package Control`. Someday this should be fixed, then only one of them attempt to do
   it. It is not always required to replace the `Package Control` by the `PackagesManager`, it
   depends on the channel configuration. However most of the commands will not work with `Package
   Control`. This is because was added some functionality to `PackagesManager`, which is not present
   on `Package Control`.

1. Currently it has the problem of showing up this error box randomly. This may or may not happen
   when you run the installer:

    ![Error Box](https://i.imgur.com/WppRKNt.png)

    This happens at this moments:
    ```
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage", "Uncrustify", ..., AdvancedNewFile", "AlignTab"]
    reloading settings Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage"]
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage", "Uncrustify", ..., AdvancedNewFile", "AlignTab"]
    reloading settings Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage"]
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage", "Uncrustify", ..., AdvancedNewFile", "AlignTab"]
    reloading settings Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage"]
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage", "Uncrustify", ..., AdvancedNewFile", "AlignTab"]
    reloading settings Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage"]
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage", "Uncrustify", ..., AdvancedNewFile", "AlignTab"]
    reloading settings Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage"]
    ignored packages updated to: ["Vintage", "Uncrustify", ..., AdvancedNewFile", "AlignTab"]
    reloading settings Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
    reloading settings Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings

        It appears a package is trying to ignore itself, causing a loop.
        Please resolve by removing the offending ignored_packages setting.
    ```

    It is unknown yet what is setting the `ignored_packages` setting to `["Vintage"]`. That is why
    was wrote this function:
    ```python
    def add_packages_to_ignored_list(packages_list):
        """
            Something, somewhere is setting the ignored_packages list to `["Vintage"]`. Then ensure we
            override this.
        """
        ignored_packages = g_user_settings.get( "ignored_packages", [] )
        unique_list_append( ignored_packages, packages_list )

        for interval in range( 0, 27 ):
            g_user_settings.set( "ignored_packages", ignored_packages )
            sublime.save_settings( USER_SETTINGS_FILE )

            time.sleep(0.1)
    ```
    Perhaps `Package Control` is doing it, as this error showed up in a vanilla install only with
    `Package Control` installed. The problem seems random and does not to happens every time you run
    the channel installer.

1. This error also may or may not show up when you run the installer:

    ![Error while loading PyV8 binary](https://i.imgur.com/elyZJ9A.png)

    ```
    emmet.pyv8loader: Unable to download packages list. HTTP error 403 downloading
    https://api.github.com/repos/emmetio/pyv8-binaries/contents.
    error: Error while loading PyV8 binary: exit code 1
    Try to manually install PyV8 from
    https://github.com/emmetio/pyv8-binaries
    ```

    It seems it cannot always download the `pyv8-binaries` as the GitHub may be throttling your
    connection as you just downloaded a lot of contents. So, you can try to manually download the
    contents at [pyv8-binaries](https://github.com/emmetio/pyv8-binaries) or just wait another hour
    and restart Sublime Text, so the package can download the contents by itself.

1. Sublime Text may enter on deadlock, while Package Control is installing the missing dependencies.
   This has a similar issue registered at
   [CoreIssues$1966](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1966)(Deadlock/hang when batch
   deleting/creating settings files). The solution to this is to notice when Sublime Text is hanged
   with no CPU usage, i.e., for some time it is unresponsive, then you need to kill Sublime Text
   itself or just kill the program called `plugin_host` or `plugin_host.exe`. After killing
   `plugin_host`, Sublime Text will became responsive again, then you can save your work and restart
   Sublime Text to restore the Sublime Text packages functionality.



## Development Problems
___

1. The Development Version currently cannot install the dependencies `debugtools` and
   `channelmanager` as Package Control always unpack package dependencies. Because to install the
   development packages, it required to they do not exists on the user loose `Packages` folder. But
   as Package Control unpacks them when installing the required dependencies, the installer cannot
   clone and install the files.

   The solution to this problem is to Package Control accept some dependencies to be installed
   inside a `sublime-package`. There is a open pull request for Package Control allowing this
   feature: [Pull$1291](https://github.com/wbond/package_control/pull/1291) Allowed debugtools
   to be import from a .sublime-package file.

   The work around to fix this, is after the Development Version installation process to be
   finished, delete the created folders by Package Control and clone these two repositories
   manually.

1. If the latest existent tag is on the form `3144`, the command which automatically update the tag
   will fail to increment/create new tags after it, as they fetch the latest tags available from
   the repository. Currently it is not implemented the code to automatically figure out such tags
   and then try the get some older tag on the correct format.

1. Use the form below to test your repository JSON to ensure Package Control will be able to index your package.
